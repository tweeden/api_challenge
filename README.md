# api_challenge

I created a UI to see the app in action.
Review server link https://apichallenge-inmguaeft.now.sh/


npm install

type live-server in terminal to startup server 

Project will run on port 127.0.1:8080

Enter a github user name (my username - tweeden) and hit search and the app will retrieve name, github id repos and url.

For testing the API use Postman and setup a mockserver.
